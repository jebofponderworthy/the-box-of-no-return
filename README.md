# the-box-of-no-return
The Box of No Return is a Linux synth platform suitable for live musicianship, designed to handle patches with enormous demands, and switch between them with zero delay.  Its current production design is discussed at https://lsn.ponderworthy.com.  This repository was created to receive the files for its next major iteration, which is using the [MultiJack](https://github.com/jebofponderworthy/MultiJACK) project at its core.
